# ELF Loader

This project is part of my homework for Operating Systems. Its purpose is to understand how an executable is loaded and run by the OS and how to treat memory exceptions. 
It implements a page fault handler which is realized with a SIGSEGV treatment routine. Main part was handling the demand paging algorithm and working with the Linux API.
